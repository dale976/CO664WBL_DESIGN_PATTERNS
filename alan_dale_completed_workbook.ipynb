    "# The State Design Pattern #\n",
    "\n",
    "### An object behavioural pattern ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\"State is a behavioural design pattern that lets an object alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.\" (Gamma et al., 1995)\n",
    "\n",
    "A program may be represented by a series of states, with each state behaving differently whislt having no knowledge of the other states that make up the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of the state pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A finite number of states of which a program can be in\n",
    "- Within a unique state, the program can behave differently\n",
    "- The program can be switched from one state to another instantaniously\n",
    "- Strategy can determine if a state can switch to other states\n",
    "- Switching rules for states (transitions), are finite and predetermined\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The state pattern manages the behaviour of an object by encapsulating its state into separate classes. The object can change its behaviour when the internal state changes. Each state class is responsible for handling its own conditional logic thus creating better encapsulation within the workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of this pattern:\n",
    "- Simplified conditional logic contained within each state class\n",
    "- Encapsulation naturally occurs as a result of state classes\n",
    "- Reusability of code and classes\n",
    "- Maintainability is often easier due to the encapsulation. Making a change in a single state class should have little to no impact on other classes or the context object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consequences of this pattern:\n",
    "- Increased number of classes due to each state needing its own class\n",
    "- Complexity in state transitions\n",
    "- Potential tight coupling between the context object and the state class\n",
    "- Not every class will utilise the state methods but will require placeholder methods\n",
    "- Program can scale more easily due to the simplistic nature of adding new state classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The state design pattern resembles the strategy pattern whereby the behaviour of the program is predetermined by conditional logic. This pattern can be useful in a program where the behaviour needs to reflect a given context.

    "### Advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "The Matter program illustrates how the state pattern can be put to good use and clearly shows the benefits of the pattern. Each state class encapsulates its conditional logic whilst not knowing of the other state classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The context class is the interface between the states and the user, the context hides away the complexity and the conditional rules of the state classes whilst providing a clean, simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state pattern can be further utilised in more complex programs by integrating it with other design patterns and data structures. The state pattern will often go hand-in-hand with a finite state machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finite State Machine\n",
    "A finite state machine is a mathematical concept created for crafting algorithms. Or, put simply, a finite state machine will take a given input and return a new state. \n",
    "\n",
    "A finite state machine will require all the given inputs to be captured along with all of the possible transitions. The finite state machine is responsible for linking those together, the state class will still be responsible for encapsulating the conditional logic to determine if that transition is valid. The finite state machine will take over the responsibility of the transition or returning to an alternative state if the condition is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real world example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are code snippets from a Sky Program that enables customers to purchase products via their Sky Set-top-box. The program is written in Typescript/Javascript and combines the finite state machine, state design pattern and MVC design pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A state class represents a view for the user, e.g: buy product, intro view, help view, PIN view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite state machine was responsible for directing the user to a particular view given the current program context. An example would be navigating from a buy product view to the program showing a PIN view for purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite state machine would handle alternative routes for error handling and would prevent the user being able to access areas not on their journey flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Setup\n",
    "This image shows the initial setup of the finite state machine. It requires all of the input routes, the possible outcomes and the handler method for when that input is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "![state machine initialisation](state_machine_init.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input handlers\n",
    "The input handler methods are shown in the above image. This code is executed when the given input is received. Here the finite state machine interacts with the state class (an MVC controller in this case) and will determine what transition will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "![state machine input handler method](routes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image shows a more complex input handler.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### State Class\n",
    "An implementation of a state class which encapsulates its unique state behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "![MVC State class example](mvc_controller.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The state design pattern on its own is a very powerful tool that can be applied in a range of program types. The common factor between the programs will come down to whether the program has unique behaviour traits based on predetermined rules. The Matter program is an easy way to visualise the concept and how it all fits together. What this example fails to get across is that, in a real world application, the complexity and scale is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state pattern complements other design patterns and concepts incredibly well. The above real world example is taken from a production program that I was involved with from its conception phase to the finished product (code snippets above).\n",
    "\n",
    "That program utilises the finite state machine along side the state design pattern and the MVC pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I learned from the real world example is that, by using the state pattern, it allowed for new transitions and states to be inserted with minimal impact on the rest of the program. Maintaining the production program has not led to any problems. The downside to the program is that a lot of boilerplate code was required to get it into a state where it could scale easily. The amount of code and class files are vast, but this is also due to the other patterns applied and the number of possible states that this program can have."

    "# The Façade Design Pattern #\n",
    "\n",
    "### An object structural pattern ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.\" (Gamma et al., 1995)\n",
    "\n",
    "The facade design pattern allows for a simple interface to a more complex subsystem with many underlying parts. This pattern is used to hide away the complexities of a system and can be used to separate concerns of different components whilst providing a single interface to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of the Façade pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single point of entry for a client\n",
    "- Simple interface providing functionality from the subsystem\n",
    "- Deals with interfaces rather than implementation\n",
    "- Hides internal complexity of a system by providing a simple interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The façade design pattern is used when the underlying complexities of a system are not needed by the client, rather, the façade will provide a simple, single point of entry to interact with. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of this pattern:\n",
    "- Simplification by providing a single interface\n",
    "- Abstraction by hiding away the complexities of the subsystem\n",
    "- Encapsulation of the interactions between system components\n",
    "- Decoupling by removing the client from the subsystem \n",
    "- Improved maintainability by being able to refactor the subsystem without affecting the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consequences of this pattern:\n",
    "- Complexity of the façade, managing the connectivity of sub components whilst providing a simple, limited scope\n",
    "- \"God Object\" façade - The façade class itself can become responsible for far too much and become hard to scale and maintain\n",
    "- Tight coupling between the façade and the subsystem components. \n",
    "- Potential for performance decrease as an extra layer of abstraction is added\n",
    "- Not very flexible if clients need to access a particular part of the subsystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The façade pattern closely resembles the adaptor pattern, but rather focuses on interface over implementation. This pattern is best used where a complex system exists but the client requires a single, simple interface. The complexities and interactions of the subsystem are hidden and only limited functionality is provided via the interface to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where this might be used is in a mobile phone application where the underlying platform APIs are required to display information to the user. The platform will provide a way for applications to interface with underlying systems and components where the complexities will be hidden, motion sensors, notifications etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another scenario would be an online streaming music platform. Its graphical user interface(GUI) will provide a way for the user to search for, and play the content. The underlying subsystems will require internet connectivity for accessing and searching through a library of content for the specified content by the user. Additionaly, permission from the platform to use the audio output, this would be an interface provided by the platform.\n",

    "Below is an example of what a Music Streaming player program might resemble. The Music Player only needs to surface basic actions to the client, the ability to do the following:\n",
    "    - Play Artist playlist\n",
    "    - Retrieve albums for an artist\n",
    "    - Play an album\n",
    "\n",
    "A façade class is created for the music player providing this limited scope of functionality to the client.\n",
    "The music player will need to interact with the platform to determine network connectivity to be able to search for music online\n",
    "The music player will need to interact with the platform to request playing audio\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the subsystem will be made up of two classes: PlatformNetworkSystem and PlatformAudioPlayer. Note, these are example classes with basic methods representing what real component classes might do.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two platform classes are then brought together by another façade, the PlatformFacade which will be responsible for managing the interaction between the system componets. The platform façade will provide simple interface in which these components can be utilised without exposing their internal functionality.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The Façade design pattern is best used when a client needs to interact with a limited part of a system. As shown in the code example above, a complete system can be made up of many complex subsystems which a client does not need to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The music streaming player is a great example of how a façade can hide away the complexities of an underlying subsystem and bring together the systems and components. From this, a façade provides a single, simple interface for the client.  In the example, the music streaming façade only allows the user the basic controls: search for albums, play a playlist or play an album. The complexities of searching for content, checking system network connectivity and taking over the platforms audio devices are encapsulated within their own classes, hidden away and decoupled from other components. This shows the benefits that the façade pattern can have in a complex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that façades can also interact with other façades and this is a great way of managing larger systems with many subsystem components and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern does come with its disadvantages as the façade file itself can become somewhat of a 'do-it-all' class and become large and hard to maintain very quickly. The façade is also very tightly coupled to the subsystem and its classes, if those change then they still need to provide the same interface to the façade otherwise it will not behave as expected. This can be made even more complicated when façades interact with other façades."
